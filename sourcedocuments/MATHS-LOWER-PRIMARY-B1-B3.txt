FOREWORD
The new curriculum for Ghana’s primary schools is standards-based, which is our demonstration of placing learning at the heart of every classroom and ensuring that every
learner receives quality education. Provision of accessible quality education for all is non-negotiable if we are to meet the human capital needs of our country, required for
accelerated sustainable national development. It is for this reason that the new curriculum sets out clearly the learning areas that need to be taught, how they should be
taught and how they should be assessed. It provides a set of core competencies and standards that learners are to know, understand and demonstrate as they progress
through the curriculum from one content standard to the other and from one phase to the next. The curriculum and its related teachers’ manual promote the use of
inclusive and gender responsive pedagogy within the context of learning-centred teaching methods so that every learner can participate in every learning process and enjoy
learning. The curriculum encourages the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) for teaching and learning – ICTs as teaching and learning materials.
The new curriculum has at its heart the acquisition of skills in the 4Rs of Reading, wRiting, aRithmetic and cReativity by all learners. It is expected that at any point of exit
from a formal education, all learners should be equipped with these foundational skills for life, which are also prerequisites for Ghana becoming a learning nation. The
graduates from the school system should become functional citizens in the 4Rs and lifelong learners. They should be digital literates, critical thinkers and problem solvers.
The education they receive through the study of the learning areas in the curriculum should enable them to collaborate and communicate well with others and be
innovative. The graduates from Ghana’s schools should be leaders with a high sense of national and global identity. The curriculum therefore provides a good opportunity
in its design to develop individuals with the right skills and attitudes to lead the transformation of Ghana into an industrialised learning nation.
For this reason, the Ministry of Education expects that learners, as a result of the new knowledge, skills and values they have acquired through the new curriculum, will
show a new sense of identity as creative, honest and responsible citizens. These are our core values that underpin the identification and selection of the learning areas for
this curriculum. These core values serve as fundamental building blocks for developing into our learners the spirit of teamwork, respect, resilience and the commitment to
achieving excellence. The Ministry endorses a quality learning experience as an entitlement for each of Ghana’s school-going girl and boy; the curriculum has rightly
focused on learning and learning progression. The Ministry has also endorsed accountability as a critical domain for effective workings of standards-based curriculum.
More importantly the role of the teacher is to make this curriculum work for the intended purpose - to inculcate in learners the core competencies and values and to
make learning happen; improve learning outcomes – and the support that teachers need is duly recognised and endorsed by my Ministry. The Ministry will support the
implementation of the curriculum to include capacity development of all teachers in the new curriculum. Teachers matter in the development and delivery of the standardsbased curriculum and we will continue to support our teachers on this journey that we have started together to put learning at the centre of what we do best; teach!
I thank all those who have contributed their time and expertise to the development of this curriculum for primary schools in Ghana.

Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh (MP)
The Honourable Minister of Education

RATIONALE FOR PRIMARY MATHEMATICS
Mathematics forms an integral part of our everyday lives. It is a universal truth that development is hinged on Mathematics. It is the backbone of social, economic, political
and physical development of a country. It is a never-ending creative process which serves to promote discovery and understanding. It consists of a body of knowledge
which attempts to explain and interpret phenomena and experiences. Mathematics has changed our lives, and is vital to Ghana’s future development.
To provide quality Mathematics education, teachers must facilitate learning in the Mathematics classroom. This will provide the foundations for discovering and
understanding the world around us and lay the grounds for Mathematics and Mathematics related studies at higher levels of education. Learners should be encouraged to
understand how Mathematics can be used to explain what is occurring, predict how things will behave and analyse causes and origins of things in our environment. The
Mathematics curriculum has considered the desired outcomes of education for learners at the basic level. Mathematics is also concerned with the development of attitudes
and is important for all citizens to be mathematically and technologically literate for sustainable development. Mathematics therefore ought to be taught using hands-on and
minds-on approaches which learners will find as fun and adopt as a culture.

PHILOSOPHY

Teaching Philosophy
Ghana believes that an effective Mathematics education needed for sustainable development should be inquiry-based. Thus Mathematics education must provide learners
with opportunities to expand, change, enhance and modify the ways in which they view the world. It should be pivoted on learner-centred Mathematics teaching and
learning approaches that engage learners physically and cognitively in the knowledge-acquiring process in a rich and rigorous inquiry-driven environment.


Learning Philosophy

Mathematics learning is an active contextualised process of constructing knowledge based on learners’ experiences rather than acquiring it. Learners are information
constructors who operate as researchers. Teachers serve as facilitators by providing the enabling environment that promotes the construction of learners’ own
knowledge based on their previous experiences. This makes learning more relevant to learners and leads to the development of critical thinkers and problem solvers.

GENERAL AIMS
The curriculum is aimed at developing individuals to become mathematically literate, good problem solvers who are capable to think creatively and have both the
confidence and competence to participate fully in the Ghanaian society as responsible local and global citizens.

3.
4.
5.

Guide and facilitate learning by generating discourse among learners and challenging them to accept and share responsibility for their own learning, based on their
unique individual differences.
Select Mathematics content, adapt and plan lessons to meet the interests, knowledge, understanding, abilities, and experiences of learners.
Work together as colleagues within and across disciplines and grade levels to develop communities of Mathematics learners who exhibit the skills of mathematical
inquiry and the attitudes and social values conducive to mathematics learning.
Use multiple methods and systematically gather data about learner understanding and ability to guide Mathematics teaching and learning with arrangements to
provide feedback to both learners and parents.
Design and manage learning environments that provide learners with the time, space and resources needed for learning Mathematics.

CORE COMPETENCIES
The core competencies for Mathematics describe a body of skills that teachers in Mathematics at all levels should seek to develop in their learners. They are ways in which
teachers and learners in Mathematics engage with the subject matter as they learn the subject. The competencies presented here describe a connected body of core skills
that are acquired throughout the processes of teaching and learning.

vi
© NaCCA, Ministry of Education 2019

CRITICAL THINKING AND PROBLEM SOLVING (CP)
This skill develops learners’ cognitive and reasoning abilities to enable them analyse and solve problems. Critical thinking and problem solving skill enables learners to draw
on their own experiences to analyse situations and choose the most appropriate out of a number of possible solutions. It requires that learners embrace the problem at
hand, persevere and take responsibility for their own learning.
CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION (CI)
Creativity and Innovation promotes entrepreneurial skills in learners through their ability to think of new ways of solving problems and developing technologies for
addressing the problem at hand. It requires ingenuity of ideas, arts, technology and enterprise. Learners having this skill are also able to think independently and
creatively.
COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION (CC)
This competence promotes in learners the skills to make use of languages, symbols and texts to exchange information about themselves and their life experiences. Learners
actively participate in sharing their ideas. They engage in dialogue with others by listening to and learning from them. They also respect and value the views of others.
CULTURAL IDENTITY AND GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP (CG)
This competence involves developing learners to put country and service foremost through an understanding of what it means to be active citizens. This is done by
inculcating in learners a strong sense of social and economic awareness. Learners make use of the knowledge, skills, competencies and attitudes acquired to contribute
effectively towards the socio-economic development of the country and on the global stage. Learners build skills to critically identify and analyse cultural and global
trends that enable them to contribute to the global community.
PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT AND LEADERSHIP (PL)
This competence involves improving self-awareness and building self-esteem. It also entails identifying and developing talents, fulfilling dreams and aspirations. Learners are
able to learn from mistakes and failures of the past. They acquire skills to develop other people to meet their needs. It involves recognising the importance of values such
as honesty and empathy and seeking the well-being of others. Personal development and leadership enable learners to distinguish between right and wrong. The skill helps
them to foster perseverance, resilience and self-confidence. PL helps them acquire the skill of leadership, self-regulation and responsibility necessary for lifelong learning.
DIGITAL LITERACY (DL)
Digital Literacy develops learners to discover, acquire and communicate through ICT to support their learning. It also makes them use digital media responsibly.

LEARNING DOMAINS (EXPECTED LEARNING BEHAVIOURS)
A central aspect of this curriculum is the concept of three integral learning domains that should be the basis for instruction and assessment. These are:
- Knowledge, Understanding and Application
- Process Skills
- Attitudes and Values

KNOWLEDGE, UNDERSTANDING AND APPLICATION
Under this domain, learners may acquire some knowledge through some learning experiences. They may also show understanding of concepts by comparing, summarising,
re-writing etc. in their own words and constructing meaning from instruction. The learner may also apply the knowledge acquired in some new contexts. At a higher level
of learning behaviour, the learner may be required to analyse an issue or a problem. At a much higher level, the learner may be required to synthesise knowledge by
integrating a number of ideas to formulate a plan, solve a problem, compose a story, or a piece of music. Further, learners may be required to evaluate, estimate and
interpret a concept. At the last level, which is the highest, learners may be required to create, invent, compose, design and construct. These learning behaviours “knowing
”, “understanding”, “applying”, “analysing”, “synthesising”, “evaluating” and “creating” fall under the domain “Knowledge, Understanding and Application”.
In this curriculum, learning indicators are stated with action verbs to show what the learner should know and be able to do. For example, the learner will be able to
describe something. Being able to “describe” something after teaching and learning has been completed means that the learner has acquired “knowledge”. Being able to
explain, summarise and give examples etc. means that the learner has understood the concept taught.
Similarly, being able to develop, defend, etc. means that the learner can “apply” the knowledge acquired in some new context. You will note that each of the indicators in
the curriculum contains an “action verb” that describes the behaviour the learner will be able to demonstrate after teaching and learning has taken place. “Knowledge,
Understanding and Application” is a domain that should be the prime focus of teaching and learning in schools. Teaching in most cases has tended to stress knowledge
acquisition to the detriment of other higher level behaviours such as applying knowledge.
Each action verb in any indicator outlines the underlying expected outcome. Each indicator must be read carefully to know the learning domain towards which you have to
teach. The focus is to move teaching and learning from the didactic acquisition of “knowledge” where there is fact memorisation, heavy reliance on formulae, remembering
facts without critiquing them or relating them to real world – surface learning – to a new position called – deep learning. Learners are expected to deepen their learning
by knowledge application to develop critical thinking skills, explain reasoning, and generate creative ideas to solve real life problems in their school lives and later in their
adult lives. This is the position where learning becomes beneficial to the learner.

The explanation and the key words involved in the “Knowledge, Understanding and Application” domain are as follows:
Knowing:

This refers to the ability to remember, recall, identify, define, describe, list, name, match, state principles, facts, concepts. Knowledge is the
ability to remember or recall material already learned. This constitutes the lowest level of learning.

Understanding:

This refers to the ability to explain, summarise, translate, rewrite, paraphrase, give examples, generalise, estimate or predict consequences based
upon a trend. Understanding is generally the ability to grasp the meaning of some material that may be verbal, pictorial or symbolic.

Applying:

This dimension is also referred to as “Use of Knowledge”. It is the ability to use knowledge or apply knowledge, apply rules, methods, principles,
theories, etc. to situations that are new and unfamiliar. It also involves the ability to produce, solve, plan, demonstrate, discover etc.

Analysis:

This dimension is the ability to break down material/information into its component parts; to differentiate, compare, distinguish, outline,
separate, identify significant points etc., ability to recognise unstated assumptions and logical fallacies; and the ability to recognise inferences from
facts etc.

Synthesising:

It is the ability to put parts together to form a new whole. It involves the ability to combine, compile, compose, devise, plan, revise, organise,
create, generate new ideas and solutions etc.

Evaluating:

This refers to the ability to appraise, compare features of different things and make comments or judgment, compare, contrast, criticise, justify,
support, discuss, conclude, make recommendations etc. Evaluating refers to the ability to judge the worth or value of some material based on
some criteria.

Creating:

This is the ability to use information or materials to plan, compose, produce, manufacture or construct other products. From the foregoing,
creation is the highest form of thinking and learning, and is therefore the most important behaviour. This unfortunately is the area where most
learners perform poorly. In order to get learners to develop critical thinking and behavioural skills beginning right from the lower primary level,
it is advised that you do your best to help your learners to develop analytic and application skills as we have said already.

SKILLS AND PROCESSES
The mathematical method is the means by which a mathematician solves problems or seeks to gain information about events. Learners should be exposed to situations
that challenge them to raise questions and attempt to solve problems. The more often they are faced with these challenges, the more likely they are to develop a positive
attitude toward mathematics, and the more likely they are to develop the relevant process skills. Details of each sub-skill in the “Values, Attitudes and Process Skills”
dimension are as follows:
Observing:

This is the skill of using our senses to gather information about objects or events. This also includes the use of instruments to extend the range
of our senses.

Classifying:

This is the skill of grouping objects or events based on common characteristics.

Comparing:

This is the skill of identifying the similarities and differences between two or more objects, concepts or processes.

Communicating/ :
Reporting

This is the skill of transmitting, receiving and presenting information in concise, clear and accurate forms - verbal, written, pictorial, tabular or
graphical.

Predicting:

This is the skill of assessing the likelihood of an outcome based on prior knowledge of how things usually turn out.

Analysing:

This is the skill of identifying the parts of objects, information or processes and the patterns and relationships between these parts.

Generating:
possibilities

This is the skill of exploring all the options, possibilities and alternatives beyond the obvious or preferred one.

Evaluating :

This is the skill of assessing the reasonableness, accuracy and quality of information, processes or ideas. It also involves assessing the quality and
feasibility of objects.

Designing:

This is the skill of visualizing and drawing new objects or gargets from imagination

Measuring:

This is the skill of using measuring instruments and equipment for measuring, reading and making observations

Interpreting:

This is the skill of evaluating data in terms of its worth: good, bad, reliable, unreliable; making inferences and predictions from written or
graphical data; extrapolating and deriving conclusions. Interpretation is also referred to as “Information Handling”.

x

Recording:

This is the skill of drawing or making graphical representation boldly and clearly, well labelled and pertinent to the issue at hand.

Generalising:

This is the skill of being able to use the conclusions arrived at in an experiment to what could happen in similar situations.

Designing of:
Experiments

This is the skill of developing hypotheses; planning and designing of experiments; persisting in the execution of experimental activities and
modifying experimental activities where necessary in order to reach conclusions.

Learners therefore need to acquire positive attitudes, values and psychosocial skills that will enable them to participate actively in lessons and take a stand on issues
affecting them and others.

ATTITUDES
To be effective, competent and reflective citizens, who will be willing and capable of solving personal and societal problems, learners should be exposed to situations that
challenge them to raise questions and attempt to solve problems. Learners therefore need to acquire positive attitudes, values and psychosocial skills that will enable them
to participate in debates and take a stand on issues affecting them and others. The Mathematics curriculum thus focuses on the development of attitudes and values.
The Mathematics curriculum aims at helping learners to acquire the following:
(i)

Commitment: determination to contribute to national development.

(ii)

Tolerance: willingness to respect the views of others.

(iii)

Patriotism: readiness to defend the nation.

(iv)

Flexibility in ideas: willingness to change opinion in the face of more plausible evidence.

(v)

Respect for evidence: willingness to collect and use data on one’s investigation, and also have respect for data collected by others.

(vi)

Reflection: the habit of critically reviewing ways in which an investigation or observation has been carried out to see possible faults and other ways in
which the investigation or observation can be improved upon.

(vii)

Comportment: conforming to acceptable societal norms.

(viii)

Co-operation: the ability to work effectively with others.

(ix)

Responsibility: the ability to act independently and make decisions; morally accountable for one’s action; capable of rational conduct.

(x)

Environmental Awareness: being conscious of one’s physical and socio-economic surroundings.

(xi)

Respect for the Rule of Law: obeying the rules and regulations of the land.

The teacher should ensure that learners cultivate the above attitudes and skills as basis for living in the nation as effective citizens.

xii

VALUES:
At the heart of this curriculum is the belief in nurturing honest, creative and responsible citizens. As such, every part of this curriculum, including the related pedagogy
should be consistent with the following set of values.
Respect: This includes respect for the nation of Ghana, its institutions and laws and the culture and respect among its citizens and friends of Ghana.
Diversity: Ghana is a multicultural society in which every citizen enjoys fundamental rights and responsibilities. Learners must be taught to respect the views of all
persons and to see national diversity as a powerful force for national development. The curriculum promotes social cohesion.
Equity: The socio-economic development across the country is uneven. Consequently, it is necessary to ensure an equitable distribution of resources based on the unique
needs of learners and schools. Ghana’s learners are from diverse backgrounds, which require the provision of equal opportunities to all, and that all strive to care for one
another both personally and professionally.
Commitment to achieving excellence: Learners must be taught to appreciate the opportunities provided through the curriculum and persist in doing their best in
whatever field of endeavour as global citizens. The curriculum encourages innovativeness through creative and critical thinking and the use of contemporary technology.
Teamwork/Collaboration: Learners are encouraged to be become committed to team-oriented working and learning environments. This also means that learners
should have an attitude of tolerance to be able to live peacefully with all persons.
Truth and Integrity: The curriculum aims to develop learners into individuals who will consistently tell the truth irrespective of the consequences. In addition, it aims to
make learners become morally upright with the attitude of doing the right thing even when no one is watching, be true to themselves and be willing to live the values of
honesty and compassion. Equally important, the ethos or culture of the work place, including integrity and perseverance, must underpin the learning processes to allow
learners to apply skills and competencies in the world of work.
The action verbs provided under the various profile dimensions should help you to structure your teaching to achieve desired learning outcomes. Select from the action
verbs provided for your teaching, for evaluation exercises and for test construction. Check the weights of the profile dimensions to ensure that you have given the
required emphasis to each of the dimensions in your teaching and assessment.

ASSESSMENT
Assessment is a process of collecting and evaluating information about learners and using the information to make decisions to improve their learning.
In this curriculum, it is suggested that assessment is used to promote learning. Its purpose is to identify the strengths and weaknesses of learners to enable teachers to
ascertain their learner’s response to instruction.
Assessment is both formative and summative. Formative assessment is viewed in terms of assessment as learning and assessment for learning.
Assessment as learning: Assessment as learning relates to engaging learners to reflect on the expectations of their learning. Information that learners provide the teacher
forms the basis for refining teaching-learning strategies. Learners are assisted to play their roles and to take responsibility of their own learning to improve performance.
Learners set their own goals and monitor their progress.
Assessment for learning: It is an approach used to monitor learner’s progress and achievement. This occurs throughout the learning process.
The teacher employs assessment for learning to seek and interpret evidence which serves as timely feedback to refine their teaching strategies and improve learners’
performance. Learners become actively involved in the learning process and gain confidence in what they are expected to learn.
Assessment of learning: This is summative assessment. It describes the level learners have attained in the learning, what they know and can do over a period of time. The
emphasis is to evaluate the learner’s cumulative progress and achievement.
It must be emphasised that all forms of assessment should be based on the domains of learning. In developing assessment procedures, try to select indicators in such a way
that you will be able to assess a representative sample from a given strand. Each indicator in the curriculum is considered a criterion to be achieved by the learners. When
you develop assessment items or questions that are based on a representative sample of the indicators taught, the assessment is referred to as a “Criterion-Referenced
Assessment”. In many cases, a teacher cannot assess all the indicators taught in a term or year. The assessment procedure you use i.e. class assessments, homework,
projects etc. must be developed in such a way that the various procedures complement one another to provide a representative sample of indicators taught over a period.
SUGGESTED TIME ALLOCATION
A total of ten periods a week, each period consisting of thirty minutes, is allocated to the teaching of Mathematics at the Lower Primary level. It is recommended that the
teaching periods be divided as follows:
2 periods per day (two 30-minute periods)

PEDAGOGICAL APPROACHES
These include the approaches, methods, strategies and appropriate relevant teaching and learning resources for ensuring that every learner benefits from the teaching
and learning process. The curriculum emphasises the:
1.

3.
4.
5.
6.
7.

creation of learning-centred classrooms through the use of creative approaches to ensure learner empowerment and independent learning;
positioning of inclusion and equity at the centre of quality teaching and learning;
use of differentiation and scaffolding as teaching and learning strategies for ensuring that no learner is left behind;
use of Information Communications Technology (ICT) as a pedagogical tool;
identification of subject specific instructional expectations needed for making learning in the subject relevant to learners;
integration of assessment as learning, for learning and of learning into the teaching and learning processes and as an accountability strategy; and
questioning techniques that promote deep learning.

LEARNING-CENTRED PEDAGOGY
The learner is at the centre of learning. At the heart of the national curriculum for change and sustainable development is the learning progression and improvement of
learning outcomes for Ghana’s young people with a focus on the 4Rs – Reading, wRiting, aRithmetic and cReativity. It is expected that at each curriculum phase,
learners would be offered the essential learning experiences to progress seamlessly to the next phase. Where there are indications that a learner is not sufficiently
ready for the next phase a compensatory provision through differentiation should be provided to ensure that such a learner is ready to progress with his/her cohort.
At the primary school, the progression phases are KG1 to KG2 and B1 to B6.
The Curriculum encourages the creation of a learning-centred classroom with the opportunity for learners to engage in meaningful “hands-on” activities that bring home to
the learner what they are learning in school and what they know from outside of school. The learning-centred classroom is a place for the learners to discuss ideas through
the inspiration of the teacher. The learners, then, become actively engaged in looking for answers, working in groups to solve problems. They also research for
information, analyse and evaluate information. The aim of the learning-centred classroom is to enable learners take ownership of their learning. It provides the opportunity
for deep and profound learning to take place.
The teacher as a facilitator needs to create a learning environment that:
1. makes learners feel safe and accepted;
2. helps learners to interact with varied sources of information in a variety of ways;
3. helps learners to identify a problem suitable for investigation through project work;
4. connects the problem with the context of the learners’ world so that it presents realistic opportunities for learning;
5. organises the subject matter around the problem, not the subject;
6. gives learners responsibility for defining their learning experience and planning to solve the problem;

xv
© NaCCA, Ministry of Education 2019

7. encourages learners to collaborate in learning; and
8. expects all learners to demonstrate the results of their learning through a product or performance.
It is more productive for learners to find answers to their own questions rather than teachers providing the answers and their opinions in a learning-centred
classroom.

INCLUSION
Inclusion is ensuring access and learning for all learners especially those disadvantaged. All learners are entitled to a broad and balanced curriculum in every school in
Ghana. The daily learning activities to which learners are exposed should ensure that the learners’ right to equal access and accessibility to quality education is met.
The Curriculum suggests a variety of approaches that address learners’ diversity and their special needs in the learning process. When these approaches are effectively
used in lessons, they will contribute to the full development of the learning potential of every learner. Learners have individual needs, learning experiences and different
levels of motivation for learning. Planning, delivery and reflection on daily learning experiences should take these differences into consideration. The curriculum
therefore promotes:
1. learning that is linked to the learner’s background and to their prior experiences, interests, potential and capacities.
2. learning that is meaningful because it aligns with learners’ ability (e.g. learning that is oriented towards developing general capabilities and solving the practical
problems of everyday life); and
3. the active involvement of the learners in the selection and organisation of learning experiences, making them aware of their importance and also enabling
them to assess their own learning outcomes.
DIFFERENTIATION AND SCAFFOLDING
Differentiation is a process by which differences (learning styles, interest and readiness to learn) between learners are accommodated so that all learners in a group
have the best possible chance of learning. Differentiation could be by content, tasks, questions, outcome, groupings and support. Differentiation as a way of ensuring
each learner benefits adequately from the delivery of the curriculum can be achieved in the classroom through i) task ii) support from the Guidance and Counselling
Unit and iii) learning outcomes.
Differentiation by task involves teachers setting different tasks for learners of different abilities. E.g. in sketching the plan and shape of their classroom some learners
could be made to sketch with free hand while others would be made to trace the outline of the plan.
Differentiation by support involves the teacher giving the needed support and referring weak learners to the Guidance and Counselling Unit for academic support.
Differentiation by outcome involves the teacher allowing learners to respond at different levels. Weaker learners are allowed more time for complicated tasks.

Scaffolding in education refers to the use of a variety of instructional techniques aimed at moving learners progressively towards stronger understanding and ultimately
greater independence in the learning process.
It involves breaking up the learning task, experience or concepts into smaller parts and then providing learners with the support they need to learn each part. The
process may require a teacher assigning an excerpt of a longer text to learners to read and engaging them to discuss the excerpt to improve comprehension. The
teacher goes ahead to guide them through the key words/vocabulary to ensure learners have developed a thorough understanding of the text before engaging them to
read the full text. Common scaffolding strategies available to the teacher are:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

give learners a simplified version of a lesson, assignment, or reading, and then gradually increases the complexity, difficulty, or sophistication over time;
describe or illustrate a concept, problem, or process in multiple ways to ensure understanding;
give learners an exemplar or model of an assignment they will be asked to complete;
give learners a vocabulary lesson before they read a difficult text;
describe the purpose of a learning activity clearly and the learning goals they are expected to achieve; and
describe explicitly how the new lesson builds on the knowledge and skills learners were taught in a previous lesson.

INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has been integrated into the Mathematics curriculum as part of the core of education, alongside reading, writing and
numeracy. Thus, the curriculum is designed to use ICT as a teaching and learning tool to enhance deep and independent learning. For instance, the teacher, in certain
instances, is directed to use multimedia to support the teaching and learning process.
ICT has the potential to innovate, accelerate, enrich and deepen skills. It also motivates and engages learners to relate school experiences to work practices. It provides
opportunities for learners to fit into the world of work. Some of the expected outcomes that this curriculum aims to achieve are:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

improved teaching and learning processes;
improved consistency and quality of teaching and learning;
increased opportunities for more learner-centered pedagogical approaches;
improved inclusive education practices;
improved collaboration, creativity, higher order thinking skills; and
enhanced flexibility and differentiated approach of delivery

The use of ICT as a teaching and learning tool is to provide learners an access to large quantities of information online and offline. It also provides the framework for
analysing data to investigate patterns and relationships in statistical data]. Once learners have made their findings, ICT can help them organise, edit and print the
information in many different ways.

Learners need to be exposed to various ICT tools around them including calculators, radios, cameras, phones, television sets and computers and related software like
Microsoft Office packages - Word, PowerPoint and Excel as teaching and learning tools. The exposure that learners are given at the primary school level to use ICT in
exploiting learning will build their confidence and will increase their level of motivation to apply ICT use in later years, both within and outside of education. ICT use for
teaching and learning is expected to enhance the quality and competence level of learners.

ORGANISATION AND STRUCTURE OF THE CURRICULUM
The curriculum is organised under key headings and annotations.
ANNOTATION
A unique annotation is used to label the class, strands, sub-strands, content standards and learning indicators in the curriculum for the purpose of easy referencing. The
annotation is defined in Figure 1:
Class

Content Standard number

B1. 1. 2. 1. 1
Strand number

Learning Indicator number

Sub-strand number
Figure 1: Curriculum Reference Numbers

Strands are the broad areas/sections of the Mathematics content to be studied.
Sub-strands are the topics within each strand under which the content is organised.
Content standard refers to the pre-determined level of knowledge, skill and/or attitude that a learner attains by a set stage of education.
Indicator is a clear outcome or milestone that learners have to exhibit in each year to meet the content standard expectation. The indicators represent the minimum
expected standard in a year.

Exemplar refers to support and guidance, which clearly explains the expected outcomes of an indicator and suggests what teaching and learning activities could take to
support the facilitators/teachers in the delivery of the curriculum.

ORGANIZATION OF THE STANDARDS (B1 – B3)
The content standards in this document are organized by grade level. Within each grade level, the contents are grouped first by strands. Each strand is further subdivided
into sub-strands of related indicators.
 Indicators are learning outcomes that define what learners should know and be able to do.
 Content Standards are groups of related indicators. Note that indicators from different standards may sometimes be closely related, because mathematics is a
connected subject.
 Sub-strands are larger groups of related indicators (or mathematics topics to be studied). Indicators from different sub-strands may sometimes be closely
related.
 Strands are the main branches of the mathematics content to be studied.

The Standards are organised at the B1 – B3 phase under four strands:
1. Number
2. Algebra

SUBJECT SPECIFIC PRACTICES
AND CORE COMPETENCIES

INDICATORS AND EXEMPLARS
B1.1.2.4.1 Use counting on, counting down and missing addend
strategies for adding and subtracting within 20
E.g. 1. Relating counting to addition (i.e., recognizing that adding 2 is the
same as counting on 2)
E.g. 2. Counting on (i.e., for 5 + 3, start at 5 and count on 3 places… 6, 7, 8.
The answer is 8.)
E.g. 3. "Making 10s" (i.e., if 7 + 2 + 3, do 7 + 3 = 10 first then add 2. The
answer is 12. Or if given 7 + 2 + 3, change the order of the addends
to 7 + 3 + 2 to produce combinations that add to 10; Or if given 2 +
6 + 4, add the two last addends first to produce 2 + 6 + 4 = 2 + 10
= 12 Or if given 8 + 3, change question to 8 + 2 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11)
E.g. 4. "Making doubles" (i.e., if 5 + 4, do 4 + 4 = 8 then add 1. The answer
is 9. Or if given 6 + 7, change question to 6 + 6, which give 12 then
add 1. The answer is 13).
Relating subtraction to counting down (i.e., Recognizing that subtracting 3
is the same as counting down 3) (i.e., for 15 - 3, start at 15 and
count on 3 places… 14, 13, 12. The answer is 12.)
E.g. 5. Relating subtraction to comparison or finding the difference
(Recognizing that subtracting 5 from 8 is the same as ‘ 5 is how
many less than 8; or ‘8 is how many more than 5;
E.g. 6. "Using addition to subtract" or re-writing as addition sentence and
finding the missing addend (i.e., if given 7 - __ = 5, change the
question to the addition 5 + ___ = 7. The answer is 2, so 7 - 2 = 5.

E.g. 4. Compensation – Adding more to a number to make it friendlier,
then subtracting the amount added from the answer e.g.
when adding 26 + 39, add 1 to 39 to create the expression 26 +
40, which gives 76, then subtract from the answer the 1 that was

order of additions to make friendlier combinations, converting a
subtraction into an addition and solving the addition) to demonstrate
mastery of basic addition facts to 18 (and related subtraction facts)
E.g.2 Make doubles when both numbers are close to doubles or when one number
is close to the double of the other by:
- decomposing one of the numbers to create doubles (e.g. when
adding 25 + 26, think 25 + 25 + 1) or
- shifting a quantity from one number to the other to create
doubles (e.g., when adding 24 + 26, think 25 + 25, or when adding 69 +
23, think 70 + 22)
E.g. 3 Make 10s when one number is close to 10 or to multiples of 10 by shifting
a quantity from one number to the other to create a multiple of 10

Eg. 2. Adding on by friendly jumps strategy, where one of the numbers is decomposed
into a friendlier number and added in “chunks” (for example, when adding 326 + 232,
start with326, add 100 two times to get 526 (326 + 100 + 100), then add on 10 three
times to get 556 (526 + 10 + 10 + 10) and then add on 2 to get 558. The answer is 558.
E.g. 3. Making 10s or 100s when adding a number that is close to
a multiple of 10 or 100 by moving a quantity from one
number to another, for example when adding 296 + 568,
move 4 from 568 to 296 to make 300 (see example to right)
E.g. 4. Compensation strategy – adding more than is required to create an easier
number to add – usually a multiple of 10 or 100 - and then subtracting that same amount
from the answer (for example, when adding 126 + 39, add 1 to 39 to create the expression 126
+ 40, which gives 166, then subtract from the answer the 1 that was added; 166 -1 = 165, so the
answer is 165)
E.g. 5. Decomposing or splitting the second number into partial subtractions that are
easier to subtract (e.g. when subtracting 127 - 38, decompose 38 and subtract in
friendlier jumps - 127 - 20- 10- 8 or see examples in text boxes)
E.g. 6. Starting at the second number and counting up in friendly jumps (e.g., when
subtracting 127 – 18, start at 18 and count up by 100 to get 118, then count up 9 to
get 127…so the answer is 109)

E.g. 7. Compensation strategy - Subtracting more than is required (to turn the 2nd
number into a friendlier number), then adding the extra amount to the answer (for
example, when subtracting 547 -296, subtract 547 – 300 = 247, then add 4 to the
answer to get 251)

E.g. 1. Give a quantity of straws (e.g. 12) and invite 4 learners to share equally among themselves by
picking one at a time in turns until all straws are finished and then asking each learner to count
and tell the number of straws they received.
B3.1.2.6.2 Use concrete and pictorial representations to explain division as repeated
subtraction or determining the number of times given equal groups can be obtained in (i.e.
goes into or can be subtracted from) a given number
E.g. 1 Give a quantity of straws (e.g. 12) and have learners make equal groups formation of 3 straws in
each group and then have learners count the number of equal groups formed.
B3.1.2.6.3 Use concrete and pictorial representation to explain division as inverse of
